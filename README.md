# My dotfiles

My dotfiles live here.

## Dotfile sync

I use dotsync to manage symlink creation for durable dotfiles with non-sensitive content:

https://github.com/dotphiles/dotsync

To sync dotfiles if dotfiles are in `~/dotfiles`:
`~/dotfiles/dotsync/bin/dotsync -L -d dotfiles`

## Useful utilities

```
pass
browserpass
```
