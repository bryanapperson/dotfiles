# My dotfiles

## Awesome WM

Compositor: `picom`
Terminal: `alacritty`

### Colors

Colors are set in `dotfiles/.config/theme.lua`, however they can be overridden by the colors in `~/.Xresources`, which is also the place to set DPI for high resolution scaling.

### Dependencies

```
picom
alacritty
maim
```

### Lua

I didn't know lua, but now I know a bit
