# Awesome WM

Compositor: `tryone-comton`
Terminal: `alacritty`

## Colors

Colors are set in `dotfiles/.config/theme.lua`, however they can be overridden by the colors in `~/.Xresources`, which is also the place to set DPI for high resolution scaling.

## Dependencies

```
tryone-compton
alacritty
maim
nm_applet
paprefs
pasystray
blueman
unclutter
luarocks
```

Optional

```
rofi-dmenu
```

### Lua

`luarocks install power_widget`

I didn't know lua, but now I know a bit

[Lua for programmers](http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/)

### GTK theme

I built the gtk theme on numix using `oomox`.

## Things to do

Add proper widgets to reduce use of systray
Reboot and shutdown key shortcuts
Integrate `redshift` night mode
